# Meta Backend Development Course Projects

This repository showcases my learning journey through Meta's Backend Development Professional Certificate program on Coursera. It contains hands-on projects and exercises demonstrating core programming concepts and web development skills.

## Course Overview

The Meta Backend Development course covers essential skills for modern web development, including:
- Python programming fundamentals
- Frontend development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Database design and management
- API development and integration
- Version control with Git

## Project Structure

### Python Fundamentals (`/python-fundamentals/`)
Core Python programming concepts and exercises including:
- **Control Flow**: Conditional statements and decision-making logic
- **Loops**: For loops, while loops, and nested loop structures
- **Programming Exercises**: Hands-on practice problems and solutions
- **Data Structures**: Working with lists, dictionaries, and other Python data types

**Key Files:**
- `control-flow.py` - Conditional logic and branching
- `nested-loops.py` - Complex loop structures
- `exercise-1.py`, `exercise-2.py`, `exercise-3.py` - Progressive skill-building exercises

### Frontend Projects (`/frontend-projects/`)

#### Little Lemon Restaurant Website
A complete restaurant website project demonstrating:
- **HTML**: Semantic markup and page structure
- **CSS**: Styling, layout, and responsive design
- **JavaScript**: Interactive elements and user experience enhancements

This project showcases frontend development skills including modern web standards, accessibility considerations, and user-centered design principles.
